                <p>A great first week!</p>
                <p>After being excited about this program for a while, I was happy to jump into the work right away. From what I had heard, I anticipated a large amount of reading, and so far it's to the level that I expected. 
                    I imagined that there would be an enormous amount to cover in just 16 weeks, and I have a feeling that it's only going to get harder from here. But I know that if I keep at it every day and do my best to challenge myself, 
                    then the effort is sure to pay off.
                </p>
                <p>Right now, my roadblock might be getting backgrounds and images to work the way I want them. On this first draft of the blog, I had some trouble getting a nice background image to function with these article blocks, but I couldn't quite make it work - you might see some unsightly seams along the sides from my clumsy attempt.
                    I'm glad I made the effort to see whether I could do it however, and am eager to learn more in the next week and maybe push this blog a little bit further!

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Chandler Ward. I'm 27 years old, and I graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2015 with a B.A. in English Literature.</p>
                <p>My current goals are to succeed in this course and start my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer and acquire a position that will continue to help grow my skills and talents. I would also like to one day work overseas one day.</p>

                <h2>Some other Interesting Thing</h2>
                <p>I have a foreign language qualification in Japanese, and can speak at around the N3 level.</p>
                <p>I also used to do creative writing for my degree, but hopefully those pieces will never see the light of day!</p>
