# Bootcamp Blog
By Chandler Ward

Thank you for checking out my blog!

It might not look the prettiest, but it's my first experiment with html and css in a while. I was able to include some basic table elements to serve as cards for the articles, the idea for which I got from w3schools.com, as well as try and incorporate some basic :hover functionality to make the page seem a little more dynamic.

I had a bit of trouble with images and div files, but again, thanks to w3, I found a workable solution and hopefully the finished product looks nicer with a bit of visuals that actually *fit* on the page.

Hope to continue to improve my skills in the future, and thanks again to all the help and assistance from the Awesome Inc instructors!
