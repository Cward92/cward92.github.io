            "P1": "A great first week!",
            "P2": "After being excited about this program for a while, I was happy to jump into the work right away. From what I had heard, I anticipated a large amount of reading, and so far it's to the level that I expected. I imagined that there would be an enormous amount to cover in just 16 weeks, and I have a feeling that it's only going to get harder from here. But I know that if I keep at it every day and do my best to challenge myself, then the effort is sure to pay off.",
            "P3": "Right now, my roadblock might be getting backgrounds and images to work the way I want them. On this first draft of the blog, I had some trouble getting a nice background image to function with these article blocks, but I couldn't quite make it work - you might see some unsightly seams along the sides from my clumsy attempt. I'm glad I made the effort to see whether I could do it however, and am eager to learn more in the next week and maybe push this blog a little bit further!",

            "Title": "Exploring Pseudocode!",
            "P1": "Hello again! It's been another long, yet exciting week at Awsome Inc's Bootcamp.",
            "P2": "This week while studying a bit of basic HTML and CSS, we began to practice our pseudocoding skills as well! I'll admit that I still don't feel very confident writing pseudocode, however, it was fun to take a project from just a simple idea like an 'Ice Making Machine' and approach it from a coding viewpoint.",
            "P3": "Finding the right balance to spend on learning new things, while working to improve old projects - like this blog D: - proved to be a bit of a challenge. So I will take that as a cue for me to work on improving myself in managing these new tasks while keeping my mind open as to how new topics can improve existing works!",

            "Title": "Oh boy, Javascript!",
            "P1": "I have been both looking forward to getting back into Javascript since first learning it in the Intro, as well as dreading the difficulty of my mental math skills.",
            "P2": "Overall, the tasks this week were fun and enjoyable, especially the silly story generator. This blog doesn't have any javascript yet, however, that is mainly due to my lack of imagination. Being able to recognize when to use javascript, and in what ways I can apply it, is just a skill that I will have to keep developing as this bootcamp continues.",
            "P3": "Now that I've seen all three slices of the cake: HTML, CSS, and Javascript; I can now safely guage my lacking skills with all three, though my understanding of CSS probably feels the most shallow, even if its importance in the bootcamp feels less stressed than the other two. Still, I hope to keep working on both my knowledge and understanding, and my persistence should give way to clearer thoughts on unique ways to improve myself and this blog!",

            "Title": "Oh GOD, JAVASCRIPT!",
            "P1": "I was right to be afraid of math! Thankfully, google is my friend and research during the week saved me for when I was attempting to complete my Digital Clock and Countdown projects.",
            "P2": "Overall, the tasks this week were fun, albeit more challenging. The Pre-Work in general has been challenging and fun at the same time. I'm not sure I could have had a more honest experience in learning the foundations for web development than I have these past four weeks. All the resources our instructors gave us were helpful and meaningful, progress never felt difficult as long as I was determined to understand and seek answers, and overcoming the difficult parts of this pre-work was helped by the fantastic assistance I received from both the 'help' channel on Slack and my instructors and classmates.",
            "P3": "I'm excited to begin work next week in-person at the offices, and can't wait to learn more about the Front End of web development!",

            "P1": "It's our first real week at Awesome Inc., and BOY it's a lot!!",
            "P2": "I can't really explain why the work is both exhausting and really fun. I've been working through projects and stuff for about 40-50 hours already this week, and I am ready for the weekend! There were some major problems and blocks that happened, but I'm happy to have pushed through them and made it through my projects pretty well thanks to both Ian and Justin's help. The codewars kata's were a lot of fun, and I was able to solve them all except for the last one we had this week which was REALLY HARD!",

            "Title": "Sixth Week at Awesome!",
            "P1": "This week was busy as usual, but I feel like I'm falling into a good rhythm. There's a lot to learn and it never feels like there's enough time in the day to both learn and finish my projects, but somehow things have been moving smoothly one way or another.",
            "P2": "We had our weekly reviews this week. I was very happy with the criticism I got and was glad that the people here at Awesome were looking at us properly while we did our work. Their expectations and review of our progress was very encouraging, and I'll try to keep up this good momentum and see if I can better myself over the weekend as well.",
            "P3": "For our projects, we had to get our blog's bootstrap-oriented, as well as create a weather api, which was hard, and although I still don't quite understand api's I'm happy with the project results. We also started on the Tic-Tac-Toe project for next week, and I am very glad to have started early, since the concepts for creating it were tough for me to wrap my head around at first. Overall, a good week! I hope next week will be even better!",

            "P1": "This week, we worked on developing our understanding of state with the TicTacToe and Calculator Projects",
            "P2": "So far, it's hard to say whether Javascript is easy to use or not. Since it's my first language, everything seems a bit difficult.",
            "P3": "But the more that I work with Javascript, the more I'm coming to understand its strengths. It's very flexible, for starters. And code that I write can be made very compact and used in multiple places. With the TicTacToe, it was especially helpful to code in this way. Again, a great week that I learned a lot from.",

            "P1": "It's React time!",
            "P2": "With the newness of React, Javascript suddenly feels a whole lot harder compared to last week. With the tasks we have to do only getting more complex as well, it was bound to trip up some people like it did me.",
            "P3": "By Thursday I was feeling much better about working with React, but ontop of onboarding several other projects, learning React at the same time certainly did cause no shortage of headaches this week.",

            "P1": "Chaos.",
            "P2": "Ontop of guest speakers, whiteboard interviews, and our refactoring of our blogs, we also have two projects due, a new one we're starting, and a final portfolio to begin organizing. Compared to the start of the bootcamp, it's probably been our busiest week yet. However, I managed to keep my head above water and finish the week with most of my projects completed.",
            "P3": "For this week, we learned mostly about react axios and firebase to use in our projects. By far, the most difficult things to grasp have been how to pseudocode effectively, despite our thought processes for how we build programs changing pretty much every week. Overall, a very tough week, but hopefully one of only a few remaining for our camp.",

            "P1": "After six weeks of front-end, we're finally ready to move on to middle and back-end next week.",
            "P2": "It's been both a lot of fun and a lot of struggle, but making it through this week is definitely a big confidence boost in my coding progress since the start of this camp.",
            "P3": "Biggest win this half has probably been doing well and persevering with my CodeWars katas. I was told that I was 3rd highest in the entire bootcamp, which was a big surprise. I had always made it a point to go back and finish our warmups, even if I didn't manage to complete them within the time limit, so it was nice to see our instructors appreciated the work I had put in. This week, we learned hooks in React, but I wasn't able to start on putting them into practice until Thursday. I plan to work on the project this weekend to make sure I'm not falling behind once we start PhP.",
